# KiCad Libraries

Set of symbols/footprints/models that I've created for my projects.

###### I'm not taking responsibility for any mistakes that I could have made. Be sure to double check all the dimensions and wiring before using in projects. 

## How to use

Download footprints (***.pretty** directories) and symbols (***.lib** files) that you want to use and add them as global or project specific libraries. To use 3D Models, you must create **SSZCZEP_MODELS** environment path pointing to **models** directory.

## Footprints

### Cherry MX

Over 400 different footprints generated using [this](https://github.com/sszczep/kicad-libraries/blob/master/footprints/CherryMX.pretty/generate.py) code. 

It includes variants such as:
* Plate/PCB mounted
* Stabilizer Plate/PCB mounted
* No LED/2 pin LED/LTST-A683CEGBW
* Normal switch mount/Kailh Socket for hot-swap compatibility
